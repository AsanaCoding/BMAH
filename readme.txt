Hey there,
actually I'm pretty interested in the Black Market Auction House and don't want to log into the game
every time I want to check which items are in, for which price and so on...
I also considered about transfering to another realm for a special item, but browsing every server on tradeskillmaster.com
would take incredible too long. So I made a little tool for me, made it more fancy, added some functions
and finally want to share it with you.
There will be more features and improvements in the next time. I would really appreciate it if some people of you tell
me your wishes, improvements and reviews to this program

Features:
- Select between EU and US servers
- Scan all EU/US servers
- Scan one server
- Display all items on the BMAH of your selected server or entire EU/US
- Filter the list by itemname (not case sensitive)
- Clear the filter
- Want to view the item on wowhead? Just double-click the item in the list
- Export the current list (.txt,.csv,excel)
- Select between different number formats

Coming Soon:
- Another column to display "Last updated ... minutes ago" to see how fresh the data is
- ø realm price and realm Quantity (if available)
- Your suggestions!

Please note that a complete region scan will take around 3 minutes, depending on your connection.
